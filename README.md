# Project T Final: Team VOM - Best Practices for Writing/Documenting code
Team Members: Vikash Raja, Musa Jalis, Otto Kwon

**Project Objective:** 

- Student will review the basics of good code writing and documentation, including using helper functions, following naming conventions, and adding appropriate commenting. Then students will learn these principles in the context of machine learning. 
- They will learn the best practices when it comes to cleaning and filtering datasets. They will learn the best practices of visualizing data, including when and when not to use certain types of graphs. They will also learn how to create simple reusable data workflows that saves time and increases efficiency. 
- Students should first go through the lecture slides, then they should read the notes in detail, then complete the quiz for concept checks, then they should complete the coding assignment. 
- The coding assignment will not only be graded on correct results, but also will evaluate the code for practices of well documented, simple, and reproducible code in the context of topics students have learned in Week 1 such as Pandas, data cleaning, and data visualization.
